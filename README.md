KatagawaBinParser
=================

Some code related to some reverse engineering I did of some Katagawa Games PSP game files

All of this code is very unorganized and I created this repository pretty much just to back up the code


If you compile the *.sln the resulting binary will open a "GRP.BIN" in its working directory and extract all files from it. It will save uncompressed PNM images instead of the compressed SHT image files in the GRP
